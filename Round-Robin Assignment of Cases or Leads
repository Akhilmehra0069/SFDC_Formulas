// The following formula example for leads assumes you have three lead queues and you want to assign an equal number 
// of incoming leads to each queue. 
// You can also assign cases using a similar formula.

MOD(VALUE(Lead_Number__c), 3)

// This formula is for a custom formula field named Round_Robin_ID that assigns each lead a value of 0, 1, or 2. 
// This formula uses a custom auto-number field called Lead Number that assigns each lead a unique number starting with 1. 
// The MOD function divides the lead number by the number of lead queues available (three in this example) 
// and returns a remainder of 0, 1, or 2. 
// Use the value of this formula field in your lead assignment rules to assign lead records to different queues. For example:
// Round_Robin_ID = 0 is assigned to Queue A
// Round_Robin_ID = 1 is assigned to Queue B
// Round_Robin_ID = 2 is assigned to Queue C
