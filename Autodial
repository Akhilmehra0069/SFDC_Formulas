// This formula creates a linkable phone number field that automatically dials the phone number when clicked. 
// In this example, replace "servername" and "call" with the name of your dialing tool and the command it uses to dial. 
// The merge field, Id, inserts the identifier for the contact, lead, or account record. 
// The first Phone merge field tells the dialing tool what number to call and the last Phone merge field uses the value of 
// the Phone field as the linkable text the user clicks to dial.
