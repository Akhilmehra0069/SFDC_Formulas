// This formula takes a group of fields and calculates what percent of them are being used by your personnel. 
// This formula field checks five fields to see if they are blank. If so, a zero is counted for that field. 
// A “1” is counted for any field that contains a value and this total is divided by five (the number of fields evaluated). 
// Note that this formula requires you select the Treat blank fields as blanks option under 
// Blank Field Handling while the Advanced Formula subtab is showing.
